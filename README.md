# Shared-Memory
A series of shared memory tutorials in R and C++ with Rcpp.
My main motivation is to provide a gallery in which related problems are
summarized and which can serve for quick look-up of problems and solutions.
The project is considered on going. So check back from time to time.

At this point also my thanks to all the people discussing this topic on Stack Overflow.

The folder contains a .Rproj file, so if you download the folder use it to set
up your new RStudio Project.
